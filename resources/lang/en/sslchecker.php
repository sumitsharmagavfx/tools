    "desc-5-1-1-1" => "The Handshake Protocol stage often precedes the SSL work process. At this stage, the encryption algorithm negotiation process and the server authentication process occur. The Handshake protocol stage will usually use a private key or symmetric cryptography to encrypt the data. The Handshake Protocol is also the stage where the client will enable the first connection to the server by accessing the website and also making an SSL connection request.",
    "desc-5-1-2" => "Recording Protocol",
    "desc-5-1-2-1" => "Record Protocol is a work stage where the data encryption process takes place. Record Protocol is also known as record protocol because this protocol will store all types, versions and lengths of data that has been transmitted. Apart from that, the Record Protocol also provides digital signatures and message digest (MD) records relating to data security. At this point, the validation process between the client and server takes place.",
    "desc-5-1-3" => "Warning Protocol",
    "desc-5-1-3-1" => "SSL can filter or filter data that has been submitted by the client at this point. This protocol will select data from clients that are considered suspicious or do not meet standards. If an error occurs during the data transmission process, the server will automatically send an error warning message. Warnings issued by servers are usually divided into 3 types, namely warning signs, critical alerts, and finally fatal alerts.",

    "desc-6-3-1" => "Choosing a certificate should be in line with the needs of the website. Determine the purpose or goals of the website before deciding on a type of certificate. This is necessary because SSL is very influential on the authentication and encryption process of a website. The description of the kinds of certificates according to the validation process is as follows:",
    "desc-6-3-1-1" => "Extended Validation (EV)",
    "desc-6-3-1-1-1" => "Extended Validation is the type of SSL certificate with the highest level of encryption. For websites with sensitive data transmission activities that need more legitimacy, such as online payments that require a lot of confidential user data, the use of Extended Validation is suggested.",
    "desc-6-3-1-1-2" => "The feature provided by Extended Validation is a green address bar along with the company name, which makes the website look classier. However, if a website wishes to have an Extended Validation Certificate, there are some special conditions.",
