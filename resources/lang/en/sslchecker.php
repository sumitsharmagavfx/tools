In this stage, the encryption algorithm negotiation process and the server authentication process occur. The Handshake protocol stage will usually use a private key or symmetric cryptography to encrypt data. The Handshake Protocol is also the stage where the client will fire the first connection to the server by accessing the website and also making an SSL connection request.',

    'list-desc-4-2-2' => 'Record Protocol is a working stage where the data encryption process takes place. Record Protocol is also known as a record protocol because this protocol will store all types, versions and lengths of data that has been transmitted. In addition, the Record Protocol also provides digital signatures and message digest (MD) records relating to data security. The validation process between the client and server occurs at this stage.',
    'list-title-4-2-3' => 'Alert Protocol',
    'list-desc-4-2-3' => 'At this stage SSL will filter or filter data that has been sent by the client. This protocol will select data from clients that are considered suspicious or does not fulfill the standards. If an error occurs during the data transmission process, the server will automatically send an error warning message. The alerts issued by the server are usually divided into 3 types, they are warning signs, critical, and finally fatal warning signs.',
