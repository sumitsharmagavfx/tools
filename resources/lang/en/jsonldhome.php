    "desc-2-1" => "What we are talking about here, is structured data for your website. Schema.org provides a way to present your information to Google in a machine readable manner.

    "desc-3" => "Why JSON-LD?",
    "desc-3-1" => "The methods used to implement schema.org before JSON-LD were available are impractical. You must add the schema.org attribute to the code snippet in your markup. The markup may have to change from page to page, even if you include the same header everywhere, for example. This makes schema.org difficult to implement. For us as plugin developers (and hence back-end), it pushes completely into the front-end development realm.",
    "desc-3-2" => "JSON-LD allows you (and us) to collect all of the data about your product and display it in one, small chunk of JavaScript code, which can be pushed anywhere on the page. This allows you to work on a schema.org implementation using JSON-LD, independently of your theme development.",
    "desc-3-3" => "You can basically add any schema to your JSON-LD block, even link traces.",
    "desc-3-4" => "In fact, in its own documentation, Google often states JSON-LD is the easiest way to add metadata to a site. These are the options that are least likely to break when you make other changes to your site.",
    "desc-3-5" => "Add scripts to your website",
    "desc-3-6" => "Fortunately, JSON + LD is set up in a standard format. Here's an example of this format for random products:",
    "desc-3-7" => "You can use any schema.org schema in JSON-LD. After adding the new JSON-LD script to your website, make sure to validate your code using Google's structured data test tool. As you can see, this can easily be templated in your theme. There are generators like this one, which can be useful in preparing a template for it. If you are using WordPress, obviously there are plugins that can help you too.",
