    "desc-1-1"=>"The first thing you need to understand is that you cannot post jobs to Google directly. The word \"job posting\" is therefore a little misleading. Instead, here's how everything else works: You post a job listing on your site and use Structured Data so Google (and other search engines) know that the page is about Job Posting.",
    "desc-1-2"=>"First of all, let's see how we can build a job post on our site:",
    "desc-2"=>"Write about a job",
    "desc-2-1"=>"The first thing you have to do is write about a job and publish it. In WordPress you will create a new post, page or custom post type (possibly via a third party Job Posting plugin).",
    "desc-2-2"=>"Now you have a post about work. However, as you may know, from my Structured Data Training, Google can only guess whether the page contains job posts. For this purpose, you need Structured Data.",
    "desc-3"=>"Add Structured Data for Job Posting",
    "desc-3-1"=>"Next you need to add Structured Data to your blog posts. The Google reference for JobPosting tells us which schema.org schema we need to use (it is JobPosting) and what properties are required to include the job posting in search results.",
    "desc-3-2"=>"Don't be afraid of the code snippets I'll show you below. If you take a closer look, you'll find that we only have key-value pairs here:",
    "desc-4"=>"Use a WordPress editor",
    "desc-4-1"=>"If you only offer one job, you can copy this code and paste it into your WordPress editor. If you are using the new block editor (\"Gutenberg\") in WordPress, you can simply add an \"HTML\" block and copy the above code into it.",
    "desc-4-2"=>"Don't forget to change the values ​​and use your own!",
    "desc-5"=>"Use a WordPress Plugin",
    "desc-5-1"=>"If you have multiple jobs or a job portal with thousands of posts, it's better to automate things, right?",
    "desc-5-2"=>"You create so-called Global Snippets and attach them to all your work pages automatically. You can deal with placeholders there that have - claim - the post title in the snippet's name property. Very easy.",
    "desc-5-3"=>"You can also copy & paste the above code into the \"import\" field of the Global Snippet. This will generate a wireframe so you can start adding placeholders.",
    "desc-5-4"=>"But what's easier is this: copy & paste the following code and you're almost done!",
    "desc-6"=>"Test Your Structured Data",
    "desc-6-1"=>"If you are using Plugin-Cache on your WordPress site, clean it! Then go to Google Structured Data Test Tool and enter the URL to the post where you have added Structured Data. If you have done everything right, Google will show JobPosting on the validation screen without errors.",
    "desc-6-2"=>"As you can see in the image, Google shows you a Preview button which you can click on. It will take you to the preview search results. However this preview is not very accurate. And sometimes the previews don't look very good. Don't be afraid and don't really care about it! If your snippet is correct and doesn't have any errors or warnings, then fine!",
    "highlight"=>"In this latest version of the Job Posting Schema Generator tool in JSON LD, you can create a so-called Global Snippet and attach it to all your work pages automatically. You can also preview. This will help you to see how your Job Posting will appear in search engines. This allows you to do some editing before uploading to search engines. We hope that this tool will help you find candidates according to specifications.",
    "whats-new-1"=>"In this newest version of the Job Posting Schema Generator tool in JSON LD, you can create a so-called Global Snippet and attach it to all your work pages automatically. With this, your job posting will be more optimized and will appear on Google's Rich Snippet. We hope that with this tool, you can post jobs to Google directly and optimally.",
    "whats-new-2"=>"Now, in the Job Posting Schema Generator tool, you can preview it too. This will help you to see how your Job Posting will appear in search engines. This allows you to do some editing before uploading to search engines. We hope that this tool will help you find candidates according to specifications.",
